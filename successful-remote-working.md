by

Thomas Betts

For both employees and employers, remote work requires intentional design and implementation to be effective. People find remote work challenging because the

These were some of the key takeaways expressed by Charles Humble during his presentation at QCon London 2020, titled "Remote Working Approaches That Worked (and

Some That Didn't)." Humble's opinions are based on his experience working at C4 Media, a remote-only company, and the parent organization of InfoQ and QCon.

Because many additional people are working from home due to social distancing, QCon has made the video recording of the presentation immediately available on InfoQ.

The first starting point for remote employees is to have clear separation between home and work. This can be done through physical separation, by having a dedicated

Successful remote work is not just up to the employees. Companies and managers must make extra effort to exhibit transparency and establish trust, because you don't

Establishing a high level of trust among remote managers and employees starts with having good meeting rituals. Meetings should be conducted on video if at all

rituals, Humble recommended the High-Performance Teams mini-book by Richard Kasperowski, author of The Core Protocols.

An established calendar of regular meetings also helps create structure for distributed teams. A daily huddle takes the place of a "standup." Because remote teams

build a higher level of independence than co-located teams, this may only need to occur twice per week to keep everyone aligned.

One-on-one meetings between employee and manager are extremely important, and must be treated as sacrosanct. These meetings are for the employee, with discussions

about their career and other personal concerns. Humble had two absolute rules: The one-on-one is not a status meeting, and managers should never be allowed to

cancel the meeting.

Strategic discussions are very challenging to have remotely, so these will usually occur when everyone involved can meet in person, which is every four months for

is obviously very expensive and a logistical challenge, but is extremely valuable. While everyone does not need to be co-located all the time, there are some

situations which are only really effective when a team is all together. These include strategic discussions and just help re-enforce the bonds between team members.

Humble shared a list of tools he and C4 have used. Slack for IM; Zoom for video conferencing; Workplace for "water cooler"-like chats; Google Docs for remote collaboration; and 15Five for private retrospectives. While these work for his team, many options exist. The important thing is to try and find what works effectively in your situation, because bad tooling can have a serious effect on remote working.

While remote work is very appealing to some employees, it does come with some trade-offs. Although the time and costs associated with commuting disappear, new costs
